  I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science at PUC-Rio/Brazil after a 4-month sandwich period at the INRIA/France. 
  Currently, I am a professor at the Brazilian School of Business and Public Administration of the Getulio Vargas Foundation (EBAPE/FGV). 
  I am also an active research member of the Laboratory of Technologies in Formal Methods (TecMF) at PUC-Rio. 
  My main research interests are the formal aspects of Computation and Software Development, 
  applications of analysis techniques to understand data and software artifacts, 
  and the social impacts of Digital Technologies in our day-by-day lives.
